   Answer this question: 
     Why was it necessary to revise this component?

3. (on line 114)
   Describe the change(s) you made to this component.

4. (on line 117)
   Enter the "Footnote nn" code followed by a detailed 
   description of that Footnote 

   When you modify a component, you should ALWAYS 
   provide at least one Footnote comment to explain:
   a. any code lines that you added 
   -- or -- 
   b. any code lines that you modified 

   If you modified a code block, it will be 
   VERY HELPFUL, if you copy and paste the original 
   code here, followed by the modified code.

   Example: 
   ----- begin original code -----
   code code code code code code
   code code code code code code
   code code code code code code
   ----- end of original code -----

   ----- begin modified code -----
   code code code code code code
   code code code code code code
   code code code code code code
   ----- end of modified code -----

   Your future self will thank you for these kinds 
   of comments.
